Data types in animation
====================================

animation does not have predifined data types for variables like C or other
languages. animation assigns data types from constants or from function results,
which also means that variable can change their data types during execution, e.g. ::

   ...
   C = 1               # C has the type integer
   ...
   C = "Hello world!"  # C is now a string
   ...
