Block definitions
=================

.. index:: Blocks

Animation uses blocks of images to form a video sequence. Typically one can put
all images for one block in one directory. Inside a single block all images will
be processed with the same routines and commands, e.g. fade in, fade out, image
manipulations etc. There is one special block which is used for post processing
in which all images can be manipulated again. This is useful e.g. for making
water marks and a duration counter or simply copyright information.
